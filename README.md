# Python-Projects

Public versions of my projects from courses and such, consisting of:

- Machine Learning projects such as predictive algorithms, their implementations, uses, from-scratch designed and hand written versions, from various sources.

- Some projects given as a homework in courses.

- Some algorithms I wrote to be used in the future, written for just practice, or to understand a topic. *(Not uploaded yet)*

*Note:* *(I need to edit the repo to folder them like I classified above)*
